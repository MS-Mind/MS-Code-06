    r"""Cross entropy loss with label smoothing regularizer.

    Reference:
        Szegedy et al. Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision. CVPR 2016.

    With label smoothing, the label :math:`y` for a class is computed by

    .. math::
        \begin{equation}
        (1 - \eps) \times y + \frac{\eps}{K},
        \end{equation}

    where :math:`K` denotes the number of classes and :math:`\eps` is a weight. When
    :math:`\eps = 0`, the loss function reduces to the normal cross entropy.

    Args:
        num_classes (int): number of classes.
        eps (float, optional): weight. Default is 0.1.
        use_gpu (bool, optional): whether to use gpu devices. Default is True.
        label_smooth (bool, optional): whether to apply label smoothing. Default is True.
